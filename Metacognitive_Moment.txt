Metacognitive_Moment

A time when I gained insight into my own learning process was my sophmore year here at conn when I was diagnosed with ADHD and a auditory/visual processing deficit. The diagnosis and treatment made a lot of things click in my head. also I was taking a psych course called psychological disorders and dysfunction. I learned a ton that year about how my brain is just wired differently and learned a lot of strategies to make my learning way more efficient. I basically did a lot of executive functioning training and also met with someone in the arc weekly to help me learn how to stay organized and manage my courseload.


A time when I observed something significant about the tutee's approach to learning was that since I personally learn in a unique way, there were times when I would verbally explain something to someone and they would just have absolutely no clue what I was saying but then I would write it out or draw it on paper or a whiteboard and then they would understand. On the other hand, with certain students (maybe students who are neurodiverse in a similar way to me), the way I would verbally explain things was perfect for their learning style and it was cool to be able to connect with the students like that and for us to see that other peoples brains can also function in a similar way.
