The goal of the project was to develop a functioning game of roulette, a casino game, where a ball spins around a wheel and players pick where they think the ball will land. In our proposal, we wanted a functioning wheel, and buttons to act as betting pieces, where a random number would be generated. If the users bet placement was correct, they were a winner. We also wanted the user to play as many times as possible

During our proposal we originally wanted a spinning .png file, that we got online. Unfortunately after several attempts with turtle.py , and pillow.py, we decided to use a graphically control wheel instead

The main compenents of the roullete game itself, include the GUI which has the basic elements of a wheel drawn to the users screen via layering, as well as a pollygon arrow, with 36 circles going around the circumfrnece of the center circle representing each possible outcome of the spin.

The spin was tricky, we originially had a random number between 0,36 get drawn to a circle highlighting it in white, representing the marble. But we realized it was very bland, so we decided to simulate a spin, by drawing each circle over one another. This turned out really nice, as eventually, we added to the animation, and had a single circle get drawn when the player hits spin. Using conditionals, the value of the randomly generated number would align with the users selection via the getLabel command. If the user picked correctly, we added the winnings to the users wallet. 

After that, we moved everything into classes, making it very easy to call seperate functions. This also made the program alot faster. At first, we had everything defined as separate functions which made it nearly impossible once we got to a certain point because we were unable to call certain things in certain places if the information was confined to the function. Once we started switching everything to classes, we started moving a lot faster. Originally, we had multiple classes each with their own methods but we ran into some issues so we threw everything into one class. This is definetly not ideal or the most efficient way to do it and if we had more time, we would have structured the code a lot more effectivly. (we also would have made it look a lot more appealing graphically. -- we tried changing the fonts but ran into issues.) Whats nice about moving everything to a class is that we could make a method that acts as the driver (play()) and then it makes it so the main function can be very short and sweet. 

Throughout the project we would always print() both the generating number and color, as well as the number and color of the users selection. this made it easy to track down bugs we had. One of the biggest ones, was getting the money to properly display to the entry box at the top. The reason we used an entry box was because, it seemed to fit the aesthetic of an online casino rather than print. Fortunately any edits to the box are not saved to avoid cheating. Tests done to the img file, are in the test folder, where we tried various ways of moving and rotating an image, but in the long run we are glad that we choose a graphicly enabled wheel rather than a picture, allowing more customization. Most of the time, we took bugs one step at a time. For this program, we worked very sequentially. we started out extremely basic and kept building on what we had, tackling each task one at a time. This means that a lot of the debugging we did was during the actual coding process. We made sure that the program worked exactly how we wanted it before moving on to the next step. (for example we spent a long long time of the spinning functionality of the wheel before we started implementing betting at all. then once we were certain that the betting buttons worked the way we wanted, we then started working on the money and checking if the user won or not.) When we were thinking that we were done with the whole thing, we then started messing with it and trying to find ways to break it and cause an error but have yet to find anything.

Future modifications we would want to make would be making it more aesthetically appealing, adding the ability to bet any ammount of money, more betting options(like having all the options that are available in real roulette), and designing a spinning wheel with an actual ball that lands on a number.

For audio, we used the elements of lab 12 using wavmod.py , we then found a website called https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/. This wes a royalty free audio cite, where we were able to get retro arcade sounds for each button click. As for the intro, we used uberduck which is a AI voice generator "text-speech". https://uberduck.ai/
