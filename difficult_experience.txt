Difficult experience as a TA:

Last year I was TAing a lab session for intro computer science and there was one student who asking for exesive assistance. All the TAs and the professor were respectful and kind but it was getting to the point where the situation was effecting how much time and attention all the other students recieved. This student did not seem to have a sense of the fact that the TAs are not in the lab sessions to be a personal tutor but rather a "communal", for lack of better term, tutor that pops around to everyone answering quick questions. This student made the me and the other TAs guilty for stepping away to help other students and would sometimes very abruptly call out to the TAs for help when we were mid conversation with other students. 

This was a difficult situation because we did not want to hurt this students feelings but it was also very difficult to get her to understand that she was not properly utalizing the TAs. Also, a lot of the time, no matter how many different methods of explanation we tried, she was not able to grasp the concepts and could not get much of the lab done without someone sitting next to her helping her through step by step. 

And the thing is, computer science is not for everyone but we couldnt have told her we thought she should drop the class. And I know everyone learns differently and especially when there might be a case where someone is neurodivergent (and in this case, I dont think this student was), because I am neurodivergent and I love computer science and my brain is wired for it but for me, writing courses are extremely hard for me.
